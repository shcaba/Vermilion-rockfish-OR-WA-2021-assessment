## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Recreational
#### Removals
Annual catches (Table \ref{tab:WA_vermilion_catches}) from the recreational fishery (1967, 1979-1989) were obtained from historical reports, and landings from 1990-2020 were obtained from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Ocean Sampling Program (OSP) and Puget Sound Baseline Sampling Program. To fill in the missing years, linear interpolations were used to find landed values (in numbers of fish) between 1968 and 1979, and to bring catch down to zero in year 1949. Discard estimates are not available prior to 2002. Based on a discard to retained catch relationship from 2002 to 2020, we estimated historical discards. Discard mortality by depth was applied to post-2001 discards estimate. Prior to 2002, a 32% mortality rate is applied to discarded fish. The sum of retained and dead released Vermilion Rockfish made up the total removal (in numbers) from the recreational fishery.

#### Lengths
Length compositions for the recreational fleet were available in 1977, 1978, 1980 - 1983, 1986, and then each year from 1993 - 2020 (Table \ref{tab:WA_vermilion_lengthsamples}; Figure \ref{fig:rec-lts_bubbs}). The number of length observations by year were quite variable ranging between 1 and 266 samples per year. Only years with samples sizes >10 were used in the model, as years with low sample sizes can sometimes destabalize models while adding little information.  The size of sexed and unsexed fish observed by the recreational fleet were between 22 and 77 cm. The mean length observed by year was much smaller in early years, but averaged around 45 cm since 1996.

#### Ages
Numbers of collected age structures vary from 3 to 150 per year since 1998, with the majority of the collected age structures coming from 2015 - 2020 (Table \ref{tab:WA_vermilion_agesamples}). No age structures were taken in 2003.  The mean minimum age for all years is 6 with the mean max age being 44.  The average age across all years is 16.  The oldest aged fish in Washington waters is 68 in 1998, but there have been several aged over 50.
