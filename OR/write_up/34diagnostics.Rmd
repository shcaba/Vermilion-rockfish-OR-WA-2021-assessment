## Uncertainty exploration


### Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities
Data treatments explored were as follows:

- Data removal (fixed life history, no recruitment estimation) 
	1. Fishery length data only (no catches)
  	2. Catch and lengths only
  	3. Catch and lengths only with Francis weighting
  	4. Catch, lengths and ages with Francis weighting
  	5. Catch length, age and indices with Francis weighting
  	6. Catch length, age and indices with Francis weighting and extra index variance
  	7. Catch length and indices with Francis weighting, estimate life history
- Data weighting
  	8. Dirichlet data-weighting
  	9. McAllister-Ianelli data weighting
  	10. No data-weighting
- Ageing error
  	11. Using ageing error from CARE exchange
- Length treatment
	12. Use option sex = 3 to maintain sex ratio in commercial data  

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:data_sensis}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-data-RE}. Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-data-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-data-depl}.

Deterministic length-based (with or without catches) models with fixed life history values view the stock scale and status to be below that of the reference model, though above the limit reference point. Bringing in the age data, while still fixing life history and not estimating recruitment, significantly raises the stock scale to above the reference model, though the stock status is similar to the reference model. Introduction of the index made little difference to the relative stock status. Estimating the life history values, even without estimating recruitment, brought the scale back in line with the reference model. The other data treatments regarding weighting did very little to change the results from the reference model


#### Model specification sensitivities
Model specifications looked at the estimation of indiviual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the treatment of fecundity and selectivity. All scenarios match the reference model specificatins in all other aspects unless otherwised stated.

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:modspec_LH_sensis} and \ref{tab:modspec_RecMisc_sensis}. Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-RE}. Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-ssb} and \ref{fig:sensi-modspec-depl}.

Fixing $M$ to the higher prior mean value while estimating $L_{\infty}$ raised both the beginning and ending stock scale and overall ending year relative stock status. Fixing growth but estimaing $M$ dropped stock scale, but preserved the stock status. Allowing either $L_{\infty}$ or $k$ to be estimated increased both stock scale and status. Fixing the life history parameters except for female $L_{\infty}$ also raised stock scale and status, though estiamating males $L_{\infty}$ made little difference to model results. Further investigation on the affect of life history values are provided in the likelihood profiles (next section).

Recruitment estimation (assuming $\sigma_R$ = 0.6) was not sensitive to a range of $\sigma_R$ values, though fixing life history values again increased both scale and relative stock status. The two remaining model specifications did little to change the reference model results.

Overall, there were no model specification sensitivity scenarios that caused the population to drop significantly below the reference model estimate of stock status, only above. When stock scale differed, unfished and current stock size offered varied similarly, with current stock size changing more, which led to increases in the relative stocks status. 


### Likelihood Profiles
Likelihood profiles were conducted for $ln(R_0)$, steepness ($h$), female and male natural mortality ($M$) values separately and varying together, female and male maximum length ($L_{\infty}$), female and male growth coefficient ($k$), female and male variability of size at maximum age. In addition, joint profiles over  $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ (that maintains a correlation structure `r round(model$cor$cormessage3[2,3],2)` between the parameters consistent with the model calculation of that correlation) were done for females and males separately. Female and male natural mortality was also covaried based on the offset in values from the reference model. Likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the featured parameter(s) at specific values across a range of values and estimating the remaining parameters. A likelihood profile offers insight into model information on a given parameter or parameter pairing, while providing an additional way to describe uncertainty in the parameter by indentifying the range of parameters within 1.96 likelihood units of the refrence model.

The $ln(R_0)$ profiles show strong support for the maximum likelhood value of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile-combo}). Population size expectedly increases as $ln(R_0)$ increases, with the increase in current biomass happening quicker than initial biomass, thus relative stock status increase towards unfished at high $ln(R_0)$ values. This is explained by the harvest rate decreasing because the removal history is fixed and becomes relatively smaller compared to the overall biomass. All data sets were mostly consistent in the information content in the profile, though the length data contained the least amount of information on $ln(R_0)$.

The steepness profile showed little information content for this parameter (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}). Despite low information content, model output show little senstivity for $h$ > 0.45, with values for relative stock status ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. Scale outputs ($SB_0$ and $SB_2021$) also showed little change across steepness values. The recruitment likelihood was the biggest driver of steepness towards a value of 1 (Figure \ref{fig:steepness-profile-combo}). 

Natural mortality profiles for females (Figure \ref{fig:M_f-profile-combo}) and males (Figure \ref{fig:M_m-profile-combo}) are consisten with each other and show a range of $M$ values for females and males supported by the data. These values are distinctly below the mean of the prior (0.1) for both sexes. The combined profile that varies female and male $M$ based on the reference offset together at the same changing value behave diretionally most like the female likelihood support values in the range of the individual parameter likelihoods (Figure \ref{fig:M-multiprofile-combo}). Scale and relative stock status are affected by this parameter, with the current spawning output being affected more than initial biomass. This is particularly true as M get larger, creating much higher biomass and higher relative stock status. The uncertainty in the relative stock status ranges from 0.5 to 0.9, very consistent with the asymptotic uncertainty intervals for this value from in reference model. The index provided the strongest data signal for natural mortality, with length and age data being much less informative, but not inconsistent with the index.

Female (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_F-profile-combo}) and male (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_M-profile-combo}) growth profiles show strong signals in the data to estimate $L_{\infty}$, $k$, and length CV at maximum age. Lengths and ages are the primary data supporting $L_{\infty}$ values similar to the externaly estimated values for each sex, but $k$ values higher than the externally estimated values. A more realistic profile that maintains the negative correlation bewtween $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ showing show similar behavior as the two separate profiles (Figure \ref{fig:Linf_k_f-profile}). Changing either value affects stock scale, though relative stock status seems robust over a wide range of values. The profile over the length variability at maximum age also has a distinct influence on stocks scale, but relatives relatives stock status in again robust to most values (Figure \ref{fig:CVold_f-profile-combo}). The female length CV at the oldest age had the biggest influence on stock status as the CV got higher, though still a small affect compared to the uncertainty in the model. Overall, the influence of growth values seems to make the population stock status increase slightly.


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data up through minus 10 years. Retrospective spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}) and relatives stock statys (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}) estimates were gnerally within the confidence intervals of the reference model, though removing 8 to 10 years did reveal a retrospective pattern in the terminal year. None of these patterns changed the overall relative stock status of the stock being above the target relative stock status level since 2000.
