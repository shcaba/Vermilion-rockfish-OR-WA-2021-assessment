## Fishery-Independent Data
There are limited sources of fishery-independent information for vermilion rockfish in Oregon.  Oregon has a number of state-specific small-scale fishery-independent surveys that were explored for this assessment. Vermilion rockfish are encountered in very limited numbers in ODFW’s hook and line survey within Oregon’s marine reserve system. Other sources of fishery-independent information, such as ROV and video lander surveys, also encounter vermilion but in extremely limited numbers. 

The trawl surveys (Triennial survey, Alaskan slope survey and the West Coast West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey) collects fishery-independent abundance and biological data off the Oregon coast. However, those survey designs do not cover vermilion rockfish habitat in Oregon, and vermilion are sparsely encountered, therefore indices of abundance were not calculated from these survey and biological data were not used.
