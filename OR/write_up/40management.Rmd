## Management 

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated fishery selectivity and removals in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` meggs. 

The `r endyr + 1` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the `r spp` relative biomass target of 40 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, of recent years was near or above the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) for most of the 1980s and 1990s. Recent years also show near target fishing levels (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}), highlighting how the sustainability of current fishing levels are very sensitive to incoming recruitment. Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.

### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

Natural mortality ($M$) was estimated by the model, though vermilion rockfish longevity is not well understood in Oregon. While the estimated sex-specific $M$ values seem well within reason, the model remains sensitive to the choice of this parameter, and therefore improving the $M$ prior (the prior used in this model may be centered on the higher end) while continuing to collect age data for future estimation within the model is important. This also plays through the collection of lengths to go with ages to continue to improve the estimation of age and growth. Future work on improving point estimates and possibly investigate time-varying life history parameters could improve model fits. 

Functional maturity (@head_applying_2020) is an emerging concept in reproductive biology capturing physiological behaviors such as delayed maturity, skipped spawning and atresia and correcting for them in the length at maturity relationship. Investigating functional maturity could improve the application of maturity in the model.

Fishery-independent surveys would add additional support for those trends seen using fishery-based data.
 
### Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the reference model with removals in 2021 and 2022 equal to the recent average removals from 2017-2020 were run based on the category 1 time-varying buffer using $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 is provided in Table \ref{tab:project}.

A decision table with uncertainty axes and proposed catch levels will be determined later.

### Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 1 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 0.5.
